+ Project summary: In this project, we created two more sophisticated neural network models to improve prediction performance.
	
**Contribution statement**: ([default](doc/a_note_on_contributions.md))
	+ Hui Xiang: Initialized group connection with Emily, provided suggestions for model 1 neural network, built and tuned model 2 in Python including label correction                         and add weakly supervised features
	+ Meghna Venkatesh：
	+ Spark Li：Testing and tuning model 1.
	+ Emily Jennings-Dobbs: Helped initiate and maintain communication within the group. Built and tuned the first model in python. Helped tune parameters and added early stopping feature to second model.
	+ Dipesh Patel：
